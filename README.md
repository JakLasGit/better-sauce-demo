A scalable, production-grade test automation framework for [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/), demonstrating modern SDET practices including **Page Object Model**, **Fixtures**, **Factory Pattern**, and **CI/CD integration**.

---

## 🚀 Why this project?
This repository is not just a collection of tests; it is a proof of concept for a scalable test architecture. It solves common automation challenges such as:
* **Flakiness** (handled via dynamic waits and Playwright auto-waiting).
* **Data Management** (using Factory and Builder patterns instead of hardcoded JSONs).
* **Code Duplication** (abstracted logic into Page Objects and Fixtures).
* **Floating Point Math** (handling JS currency calculation issues).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

The framework relies on strong typing and separation of concerns:

| Pattern | Usage in Project |
|:---|:---|
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | Encapsulates page locators and interactions (`pages/`). Tests read like business requirements. |
| **Test Fixtures** | Dependency injection for Pages and Users. |
| **Factory Pattern** | Centralized creation of test data (`UserFactory.createStandardUser()`). Simplifies test setup. |
| **Builder Pattern** | Fluent interface for constructing complex data objects (`UserBuilder.setUsername()...`). |
| **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** | Strictly typed interfaces for models (`models/user.model.ts`). |

## 💡 Why this architecture? (Business Value)

This project is not just about clicking buttons; it demonstrates a mature approach to Quality Assurance engineering:

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** Test intent ("User buys a bag") is separated from implementation ("Click div #id-123"). This means UI changes don't break the logic of the test, only the page object locator.
2.  **Scalability:** The use of **Fixtures** means we can scale to hundreds of tests without duplicating setup code (`beforeEach` hell).
3.  **Flakiness Resistance:** Custom retry strategies and Playwright's auto-waiting mechanisms ensure that CI builds stay green unless there is a real bug.
4.  **Type Safety:** TypeScript interfaces (`User.model.ts`) ensure that we never pass invalid data structures to our tests, catching errors at compile time, not runtime.

### 🚫 Why NOT BDD (Cucumber/Gherkin)?
While BDD is popular, this project consciously chooses **pure TypeScript** because:
* **Complexity:** Gherkin adds an extra layer of abstraction (Regex matching steps) that complicates debugging.
* **Speed:** Direct code execution is faster and easier to trace than parsing `.feature` files.
* **Target Audience:** For this specific project, the goal is technical excellence and maintainability for SDETs, rather than creating non-technical documentation for Product Owners.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Core: Playwright + TypeScript

* Assertion Engine: Jest Expect (built-in Playwright assertions)

* CI/CD: GitHub Actions (runs on Ubuntu-latest)

* Reporting: Playwright HTML Report & Traces

## 🧪 Scenarios Covered
The test suite covers critical business logic, going beyond simple "happy paths":

1.  Money Maker Flow (E2E): Full checkout process validation.

2.  Financial Integrity: Validates if Item Total + Tax exactly matches Total (handling JS floating-point precision issues).

3.  Inventory Sorting: Verifies algorithm correctness for "Price: Low to High" and others.

4.  Negative Testing: Validates form constraints and error handling logic.

5.  Performance Handling: Ensures stability for performance_glitch_user without flaky failures.

6.  Security: Verifies that locked-out users cannot access the application.

## 🏁 Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or higher)

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push and pull_request.
* Workflow file: .github/workflows/playwright.yml
* Artifacts: HTML Reports are automatically generated and attached to workflow runs.
